# Part-4: Pong
My version of the classic game: Pong. 
How to play:
  Click anywhere on the window to start.
  Player 1 uses the 'W' and 'S' keys to move their paddle up and down respectively
  Player 2 uses the mouse to move their paddle up and down
  If you miss the ball, your opponent gets a point.
